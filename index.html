    Yerushalayim is the most beautiful city in the world. Here are some of the
    most signifigant religious and cultural site in all of Judaism. Despite centuries of exile,
    loss and pain the Jewish people have never ceased to yearn to return to this holy
    city. Unfortunatley, with the devastating pandemic that has wrecked havoc on the
    whole world the gates to this holy country and specifically this holy city have
    been shuttered to the world. Like in times of past exile, Jews of the world can
    only hope to one day return.
